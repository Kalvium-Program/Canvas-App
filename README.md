# Canvas-App
A application where we can upload te image of our favourite superhero, add colouring buttons and colour the image using our colour palette.
In this application, we will have 4 iterations

Include your favourite super hero's image by pasting  a SVG

## Iteration 2
Build the coloring buttons

## Iteration 3 ( in CSS file)
 Style the coloring buttons 

## Iteration 4 (In JS file)

#### Please Note
A testing utility is added to the project, on performing the iterations correctly the specifications will be passed.

Happy Coding:)
